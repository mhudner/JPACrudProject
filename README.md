# JPACrudProject

## Description of Project
In this project we were asked to create our own databases based upon a topic of our choosing. I chose to track the health of myself and others by having input fields for a username, date, steps walked, how much sleep time, how many ounces of water you drink and your mood. We were then tasked to create a stylized webpage to view table information, create a new log, update an exsisting log or delete an entry.
